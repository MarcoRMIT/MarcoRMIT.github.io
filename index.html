        <p>
          The first element that really caught my attention as soon as the page
          finished loading was the high-quality video shots of what I quickly
          assumed correctly to be the Designer, Rich Brown himself, in a
          brutalist warehouse interior setting, looking very sharp and
          concentrated, with simple attire and interesting shots really radiate
          his mindful impression.

        <ul>
          <li>Wiggling the mouse to play with the custom pencil toy cursor</li>
          <li>
            Pressing on random elements such as the video, texts, and the big
            “B” and “R” letters on the left
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressed the “+” button hoping to find his work but only his contact
            details
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolling M3, eager to find a showreel or at least an instance of
            his work

          3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most of my time in this experience was spent observing his work while
          engaging with different ways of viewing it through various animations.
          For example, when scrolling through his six signature displayed works
          (Bathmate, Villainy, Intentional Spaces Summit, Green Room, Your Brain
          On Art, Ivy Park), the horizontal scrolling of the panels is always
          smooth and fluid. Additionally, hovering over each panel causes it to
          move vertically, making the experience feel interactive and giving
          users a sense of control over how they explore his portfolio. This
          design choice effectively sparks curiosity and encourages users to
          click on the panels to learn more.

      <div class="box4">
        <h4>
          4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes, I intentionally step away from the keyboard after hovering
          or clicking on something to see how the site reacts. From there, I
          observe from left to right, noticing any differences and gaining a
          deeper appreciation for the ‘idle’ animations or movements the
          designer has incorporated. For example, the looped rotating text in
          the top right that says 'Good Shit' ensures there's always something
          to look at. Additionally, the panels themselves function as videos,
          reinforcing the intent for users to focus more on visuals rather than
          reading.

      <div class="box5">
        <h4>
          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          With it being a portfolio of a somewhat renowned User Experience
          designer, it is clear that the site is designed to draw us in through
          eye-catching visual movements and interactive elements, mainly using
          our scroll wheel. Another thing is that his site is so hard to read.
          It’s as if he does not want us to read any of the texts, just to focus
          more on the visuals. His goal is for us to explore the site, hovering
          over different parts to discover hidden details, scrolling to reveal
          more, and engaging with the visuals playfully. Throughout this
          process, the designer seamlessly showcases his work and achievements
          in an immersive way that makes us want to keep exploring while
          ensuring the experience remains informative, engaging, and
          non-repetitive to look at.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box6">
        <h4>
          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The interactive experience effectively communicates its goal by using
          motion, responsiveness, and intuitive interactions to guide the user
          engagement through this experience. For example, you will never find
          his work without scrolling; that sense of curiosity makes us want to
          find his actual works after getting the good first impression on his
          stunning welcome page, complimenting the web over an existing
          compliment/praise. The scroll-based animations direct attention to new
          elements popping up every second as we play with it, making the
          experience feel intentional and effortless.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, hover effects introduce an element of discovery, subtly
          rewarding users for exploring and reinforcing the idea that
          interaction is key to uncovering the designer’s work. The pacing of
          these interactions ensures that users remain engaged without feeling
          overwhelmed, keeping the experience immersive while maintaining
          clarity and focus on the designer’s achievements.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box7">
        <h4>
          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h4>
        <p>
          Well, considering stuff about session lengths, repeat visits, and
          inveractivity’s role. I would say that the experience as a whole was
          designed for BOTH short and extended interactions. On the first visit
          and glance on the page, I think most users would spend a few minutes
          exploring the smooth movements and interactive elements, as in
          engaging with different panels and texts to uncover hidden details and
          movements. However, the eye-straining texts, dynamic design, idle
          animations, and subtle interactions encourage users to revisit either
          out of curiosity to explore more in deeper depth.

      <div class="box8">
        <h4>
          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The interactive experience communicates how it should be engaged with
          over time through its use of smooth scrolling and fluid transitions
          that create a sense of a somewhat immediate flow. Moreover, it
          encourages the users to explore at their own pace and progress. Over
          time, the use of idle animations, looping texts, and hover effects
          concludes that this experience isn’t meant to be rushed because it all
          unfolds gradually.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box9">
        <h4>
          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The experience pulls from a bunch of different media influences, both
          digital and physical, which makes sense given the designer’s
          background. From what I found, he was influenced by illustrations,
          architecture drawings, retro tech, and computers growing up, and you
          can really see that reflected in the site’s design. It feels like a
          mix of a showreel and an interactive exhibition, where you’re meant to
          sit back and take in the visuals rather than actively searching for
          content. The smooth animations and transitions give it a cinematic
          vibe, almost like a motion graphics piece that unfolds as you scroll.
          The hover effects and scrolling mechanics feel a lot like video game
          interfaces, where you’re rewarded for exploring. Plus, the bold
          visuals and dynamic text remind me of modern advertising or magazine
          layouts, grabbing attention while keeping the experience smooth and
          engaging.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box10">
        <h4>
          10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Just sit back and let the website do the work—it’s designed to be an
          immersive experience without needing much effort to explore. It flows
          naturally, making things easier for both us as users and the UX
          designer’s vision. It’s kind of like watching a movie or a showreel,
          where everything is presented smoothly, so you can just take it in
          without overthinking.

          11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Similarly said, I think we should have a sense and feeling of being
          laid-back and at ease as we go through different elements of the site.
          As we go through those panels and works, users will be able to fully
          analyze and admire the different pieces in his design portfolio
          without focusing too much on the animations or transitions surrounding
          them. Moreover, the website design wants us to take our time with no
          intention of quickly skimming through them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box12">
        <h4>
          12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h4>
        <p>
          In general, the most frustrating part of the experience for me is how
          some panels for a single project are spread out and not placed close
          together. Additionally, the varying panel sizes, while visually
          striking, force the viewer’s eyes to constantly move from top to
          bottom and left to right just to grasp the full context and art style
          of a particular piece.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond that, the site deliberately makes text and images pop out with
          an almost ‘in-your-face’ approach. While this bold design choice is
          attention-grabbing, it can also be quite eye-straining and even
          frustrating at times. It almost feels like being bombarded with
          advertisement pop-ups as I scroll through his list of other works,
          especially with the large, all-caps white text (excluding his six
          signature projects).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box13">
        <h4>
          13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h4>
        <p>
          After playing and exploring the website countless times for maybe more
          than a handful of hours, I would have to say the custom animated mouse
          cursor has easily entertained me the most out of all things. It’s
          never-ending and always a treat to wiggle your mouse before scrolling
          or clicking into a panel.
