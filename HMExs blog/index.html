    <h1>Exhilarating Design Artwork Assignment</h1>

    <h2>1. The Vessel at Hudson Yards, New York</h2>
    <p>For the first example, in architecture, it might be a structure that looks as if it is rising boldly into the sky or twists in a way that defies your expectations. Which brings us to my first design example, which is The Vessel at Hudson Yards, New York.</p>
    <img src="path_to_image" alt="The Vessel at Hudson Yards">
    <p>Architecturally, its towering honeycomb-like structure draws the eye upwards and invites physical movement through its spiraling staircases. The sense of verticality, repetition, and open air all create a thrilling spatial experience. Moreover, the underlying mechanics are rooted in visual rhythm, symmetry, and scale (makes me feel tiny or powerless; maybe megalophobia?).</p>
    <p>This structure best represents exhilaration because the constant shift in perspective as you ascend or descend mirrors the emotional lift you feel, the same way a piece of music might build to a climax. According to architectural theorists like Juhani Pallasmaa, when architecture activates the full range of human perception—not just what we see but how we move, feel, and inhabit a space—it creates a deeper emotional and psychological impact. The Vessel succeeded in giving me that when I first experienced it.</p>
    <p>Some of the mechanics that I might apply or try to replicate in my design work would include the incorporation of verticality and layered transitions, such as using rising paths or structures that gradually reveal new views or stages (and it pulls you into it). Second and last, the use of repetition and rhythm in form, such as intertwining lines, staircases, or built-up narrative momentum.</p>

    <h2>2. The Tetris Effect</h2>
    <p>My second example is The Tetris Effect, which stands out as an exhilarating experience not just because of the gameplay, but because of how it fully immerses your senses. Although the game has simple mechanics with the repetitive action of rotating and dropping blocks, this particular version gradually transforms the experience into something visually stunning and overwhelming as you progress.</p>
    <img src="path_to_image" alt="The Tetris Effect">
    <p>I build serotonin as every movement syncs with fast-paced music, blended with a diverse movement of light that’s ongoing in the background. I realized how valuable the synesthetic experience of your eyes, ears, and hands all working together is. It forces you to stay nonstop engaged with the experience, and I want to incorporate that. Hence, in my own design work, I want to explore how that kind of multisensory layering can force full engagement.</p>
    <p>The psychological aspect of The Tetris Effect keeps you locked in, with sound and visuals responding instantly to every action, creating an addictive yet emotionally charged rhythm that builds exhilaration naturally. I am interested in designing interactions or experiences that make users feel immersed and aware of their senses at every moment, so that engagement isn’t just required, it is felt.</p>

    <h2>3. Ryoji Ikeda’s 'test pattern'</h2>
    <p>Ryoji Ikeda’s ‘test pattern’ is one of the most exhilarating audiovisual installations. Though it might overlap with the theme of mesmerizing, I still find this to be appropriate. The velocity of visuals flashing hundreds of frames per second purposely disorients and energizes the senses at once. It’s not just intense; it’s immersive.</p>
    <img src="path_to_image" alt="Ryoji Ikeda test pattern">
    <p>Ikeda explains that test pattern was created to “explore how far technology can push our senses and how close it can get to the limits of what we can physically see and hear.” The rapid alternation between black and white, silence and sudden noise, builds a kind of emotional momentum that feels like a non-verbal crescendo. It’s minimal but unforgettable, hitting you hard.</p>
    <p>In my own design work, I want to create experiences that demand full sensory attention, similar to how test pattern uses precision and repetition to pull you in. It doesn’t allow passive observation; it forces engagement. This total absorption is what creates the feeling of exhilaration.</p>
