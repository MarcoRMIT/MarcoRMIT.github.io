    <h2>HMsEX Week 1:</h2>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Reflection:</h4>
    <p>Although I was a late comer in this studio, as my first class session was in week 2 when we first entered and experienced the past student examples/work at RMIT Capitol, it quickly helped me get a grasp of what this studio I was cluelessly diving into would be like.</p>
    <p>At this stage, I don‚Äôt yet have a clear vision of what kind of multisensory experience I want to explore and develop. During the first week of university, I was already being introduced to new software and a variety of technical skills in my other classes, such as game engines and visual programming gizmos. From what I observed through the examples that Mark showcased and thoroughly analyzed, I believe the best approach is to experiment with different elements and interaction mechanics along the way, supported by self-driven research aligned with our interests and strengths, and documented weekly in this blog. Thankfully, by the end of Week 1, I found myself drawn to the adjective ‚ÄòExhilarating‚Äô as a central theme for my upcoming creative works.</p>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Progress:</h4>
    <p>For Weeks 1 and 2, I will be researching the 10 chosen artworks and installations, focusing on their descriptions, underlying concepts, and the mechanics used to make each work exhilarating. This will form the basis of my first assignment submission. For the second assignment submission and presentation, I will conduct more in-depth academic research into the specific mechanics these works used to evoke my chosen adjective, from there I will funnel it down to 3 main sources with 3 artists with their works.

    <h2>HMsEX Week 2 - 31/07/2025:</h2>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Reflection:</h4>

    <p>This week‚Äôs lecture got me reflecting deeply on how people perceive experiences differently depending on their sensory world or Umwelt. As someone who works in 3D visualisation and real-time environments, especially with tools like TouchDesigner, I‚Äôm constantly aware that what feels immersive or exhilarating to me might hit differently for someone else. The idea that each person‚Äôs background, cultural, emotional, sensory, affects how they read space, light, or sound really stuck with me. </p>
    <p>The example of Speer's "Cathedral of Light" made me think about how scale, repetition, and vibration can go beyond just spectacle. They can trigger deeply felt, almost synesthetic responses. As a 3D visual artist,I often try to recreate these larger-than-life sensations using motion, light, and rhythm inside digital environments. The big takeaway for me this week is that true exhilaration doesn‚Äôt always come from the visual alone. It emerges when sensory layers converge and resonate with the viewer on a personal level. </p>

    <h5>Creative Practice</h5>
    <p>I plan for the very first few weeks of this studio to be dedicated to new software training where I (self-learning) with ongoing experiments with different programmes to get to my desired outcome for this project. Learning new techniques, mechanics, and software addons through tutorials online. The following are some YouTube tutorials that I have gathered in links and plan to learn from. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/2EwQSCZ0Hs8?si=PqSAu6Tf08_3oLMJ"> Morphing between objects (Instancing) </a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/Y3qoGoY1NyQ?si=S0-OJlgB77vqksfm"> 3D Shapes and Particles </a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/NGL1BNI-mgM?si=sVE_WBbnQdas2OJh"> Animated .fbx into Particles </a></li>
</ul>





    <h5>Technical</h5>
<p>On the technical front, I‚Äôm currently learning how to better sync audio frequencies to real-time visuals inside TouchDesigner using CHOPs and TOPs, which also helps me in training my techincal ability in controlling the program while exploring it in my specialisation class this semester.</p>
    <h4>‚ó¶ Progress:</h4>

    <p>Since I will be incorporating my animated FBX files (animated 3D objects) and importing them into the TouchDesigner program, I reflected on my past works and projects to assess how time-consuming it can be to manually 3D model, rig, and animate assets. This led me to discover an AI tool called TripoAI, which can significantly speed up my creative process and overall workflow. TripoAI can generate 3D models in a matter of minutes or even seconds based on uploaded reference images. While the wireframes and overall topology of the generated models are often messy and inefficient, with limited options for modification, they can still serve as useful proportional references for my 3D modelling practice.

    <h2>HMsEX Week 3 - 5/08/2025:</h2>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Reflection:</h4>
    <p> David Lynch‚Äôs work was used as an example, particularly his way of turning images into experiences that feel like paintings with sound. In shows like Twin Peaks: The Return, his intention was not for the content to be consumed casually on a television, but in a cinema environment where the lighting, the audience‚Äôs position, and the atmosphere would all influence the experience. It highlighted how context changes the way we perceive meaning. </p>
    <p>We also discussed the mechanics of novelty, and how our baseline expectations affect perception. Our brains constantly rely on stored memories to shape how we interpret what we see and hear. Each sense has its own ‚Äúnormal‚Äù baseline, so when stimuli are congruent, we process them almost automatically. But when something feels off or unexpected, it grabs our attention. This ‚Äúhidden novelty‚Äù is created when something looks or feels familiar, yet behaves in an unfamiliar way. For example, in the Jazz Catastrophe piece, the experience plays with audience expectations and disrupts their sense of normality.</p>
    <p>The goal is to evoke a meaningful emotional response in the audience, whether that is joy, unease, or even the impulse to leave the room. In some cases, like in brutalist experiences, provoking discomfort or giving the urge to get your eyes off of the screen. Another example that was connected to our theme of exhilaration was the Rain Room installation. It works by flipping expectations. You step into what looks like a normal downpour of rain, but instead of getting wet, you stay completely dry as the sensors respond to your movement. This contradiction between the familiar and the unfamiliar creates a powerful emotional reaction. It ties directly to the mechanics of novelty, where the disruption of baseline expectations becomes exhilarating.</p>
    <p>Finally, some designs may feel deeply satisfying to the artist, but may not resonate with the audience. While authentic passion is important, there is also a need to combine it with affective techniques that can trigger universal emotions such as awe, fear, or transcendence. Otherwise, the work risks being too subjective, connecting only with a small number of people. The challenge for us as designers I would say is to strike a balance, creating work that is both personal and universally engaging.</p>
    <h4>‚ó¶ Research:</h4>
    <h5>Academic</h5>
    <p>I have structured my presentation in the best way possible without exceeding the 5-minute limit. Each artist's example explains a specific technique or method that evokes a sense of exhilaration in their work. These include: Exhilaration through Repetition & Movement in Static Form, supported by the mere-exposure effect theory and the use of repetition in design; Exhilaration through Gamelan‚Äôs sound, leaning toward cultural audio design and backed by Tenzer‚Äôs study on Gamelan‚Äôs distinct ‚Äúpropulsive rhythmic layering‚Äù; and finally, Exhilaration through Choreographed Complexity, further supported by Berlyne‚Äôs theory of ‚Äúarousal potential‚Äù and a quote from Juhani Pallasmaa‚Äôs architectural theory on fully experiencing a design. All three distinct techniques are supported by their examples to strengthen my proposal presentation, which I shortened to explain my concept within 5 minutes efficiently. </p>

    <h5>Creative Practice</h5>
    <p>This brings me back to my preferred definition of this adjective. With ‚Äòexhilarating‚Äô meaning a visual phenomenon that radiates an uncontrollable surge of energy, I feel it is an aesthetic quality that goes beyond passive observation, actively engaging the viewer through dynamic composition, unexpected forms, and intense sensory stimulation. Hence, I believe the best way to keep an audience‚Äôs attention constantly on the screen would be by diving into the themes of metamorphosis and the instancing between objects and visuals. The learning process I will be engaging in will also benefit my specialization class within this course, which involves learning visual programming with the TouchDesigner software. This way, I will be practicing my software knowledge of TouchDesigner while also building a studio project surrounding the themes of metamorphosis to evoke exhilaration. </p>

    <h5>Technical</h5>

    <h2>HMsEX Week 4 - 14/08/2025:</h2>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Reflection:</h4>
    <p> Today‚Äôs lecture was all about colour theory. Colour can be used to set the mood, create focus, convey emotion, establish the context of time and space, create contrast, guide transitions between scenes, and enhance storytelling. </p>
    <p>How you combine the colour of light with sound can set an unexpected context. Colour is both contextual and subjective. Most of the time, artists aim for tonal and naturalistic colour choices. However, depending on the goal and theme, colour can also be used in unexpected ways to shift the meaning of a scene.</p>
    <p>I particularly liked Mark‚Äôs attempt at creating the sound design for a screenshot of that strange-looking dark blue room. It sounded exactly how it looked, as if we were inside the girl‚Äôs mind, hearing the scene through her ears. In one movie example Mark showed (I didn‚Äôt catch the name), he explained how the first few scenes appeared effortless and naturalistic. But as the movie progressed, viewers began to question the realism of the locations, for example, whether the hotel was an actual place or just a set. Combined with the actors‚Äô horrifying expressions and dramatic lighting, it created a deeply uncanny feeling.</p>
    <p>Mark also introduced us to David Lynch‚Äôs Eraserhead. The opening scenes made me feel quite uncomfortable, building a sense of suspense as if something was about to happen, yet unfolding slowly, without dialogue. I almost wanted to stop watching, the disturbing and unsettling sounds, the uncanny expressions of the actors, and the overall lighting were intense. The father‚Äôs constant nervousness (even when the main character simply picks up a knife) and the infamous chicken scene, which was utterly disgusting, amplified the tension. The exaggerated sound design created a visceral reaction, with certain actions accompanied by sounds that didn‚Äôt match realistically. There was no traditional music, but the sound design, paired with long, distant shots, powerfully evoked emotion. The parents‚Äô reactions like the father gave out a sense of anxiety. The mother‚Äôs hard breathing and the trauma she showed facially when he cut that chicken really sold it.  </p>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Reflection:</h4>
<p>This week, Mark taught us how to fully utilize the RMIT library for additional academic research we may need to do. He also introduced us to ResearchRabbit, which is an essential tool for managing gathered research papers. It links you to different papers related to your chosen theme, creating an ecosystem of studies that could be relevant to your research (ranging from the least to the most relevant). By selecting one paper, the app can expand outward and suggest others that connect to it.
</p>
<p>When skim reading an academic paper, it‚Äôs important to focus on the article keywords. These keywords are what you then type into search engines like Google Scholar as a starting point for further research.
</p>
<p>Another AI tool Mark introduced was ChatPDF. This tool allows users to interact with PDF documents conversationally, asking questions about the content and receiving accurate, context-aware answers directly from the document. For example, we can prompt it to summarize a study or highlight specific insights, which helps us get to the core of the paper without reading it word for word. This makes research more efficient, which is valuable since the purpose of this studio is to explore, experiment, and learn mechanics and techniques that evoke our chosen emotional state. Mark described it as ‚Äúa tutor bot.‚Äù
</p>
<p>To find more specific academic resources from a medical or scientific perspective, Mark introduced us to PubMed, a search engine run by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. As a workflow, I could find resources and PDFs related to my chosen theme and then process them through ChatPDF to branch out and explore further connections.
</p>
<p>He also shared a method from a friend with ADHD: searching for academics by name and then looking up their talks or interviews on YouTube. These talks often count as academic resources and can even be quoted, making them another valuable avenue for research. I may explore this method as well, since the word ‚Äúexhilarating‚Äù is not very common in most search engines or online libraries.

<p>This week, we were briefed on the third assignment: a graded milestone presentation scheduled in the syllabus for the 21st of September, with the final product due on the 19th of October (to be submitted as a file upload). I should prepare something by next Tuesday.</p>

<p> <b>The 5 minute Progress Presentation should include:</b> </p>

  <li>Details of my major project progress </li>
<li>Evidence of work (draft stage, not completed)</li>
<li>What is going well, what has been challenging, and what still needs to be done</li>
<li>A link between my research, my chosen state, and the devices I‚Äôve been employing to realize it</li>
<li>A timeline of where I‚Äôm at (using my Canva template)</li>
<li>An overview or summary of my blog progress</li>

<li>A 5-minute presentation detailing my major project progress</li>
<li>A video recording with a voiceover, uploaded as a zip file (including project assets)</li>
<li>An excerpt of the final work to be played</li>
<li>Reflections on what I‚Äôve learned, how theory has been applied, and my overall takeaways</li>
<li>The final product to be presented in the Capitol in Week 13</li>

    <p> <i>Reaper Sound Design start (reanalyzing my old Balinese-themed sound design project) </i></p>
    <p>Before diving into Reaper DAW and starting on the sound design for my visual work based on the stages and Exhilaration Arc I‚Äôve established, I looked back at one of my proudest sound design assignments from my first year, second semester. It was a project also centered around the themes of Nusantara and Bali, where I utilized a diverse range of Foley and traditional musical elements, including xylophones, slendro melodies, bamboo chimes, and especially gamelan, with a touch of Javanese slendro influence.</p>

  <ul class="link-list">
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/44fT0eolAXU">Have a listen</a></li>
</ul>

      <h5>Technical</h5>
    <p>My sound design in this project immerses listeners in a rich soundscape that captures the essence of Nusantara's natural beauty and cultural diversity. Through this audio experience, I aimed to share a glimpse of my roots while embracing my new surroundings. It was a delight to work through this process of learning and experimenting. The plugins and sound effects I added to the various MP3s made me realize how powerful sound can be in shaping our emotions and thoughts. It effortlessly tricks our brains into believing we‚Äôre in another realm or space.</p>
    <p>Upon revisiting this old project, I‚Äôve managed to refamiliarize myself with the Reaper DAW UI and its basics, and even reflect on how I utilized the gamelan sound. Gamelan is very unique, and it can be played in different ways that produce a diverse range of melodies, all depending on the tempo of play.</p>

    <h4>‚ó¶ Reflection:</h4>
<p>I didn‚Äôt attend the 1 pm RMIT Capitol session as I have no intention of using the Capitol to showcase my audiovisual work. At 3 pm, we had a joint studio session with the Audiovision students in the Blackbox. During this, we went through Mark‚Äôs sound design process for a horror feature film he is working on, My Animal. Seeing his workflow, the uncolour graded version of the film, and the difference between the raw cut and the polished audio and music, and how all these elements interlock, reminded me of the level of dedication and effort I need to pour into my own creative work.</p>
<p>I also realized firsthand how impactful sound design is in moving images. Although the film falls within the horror genre, I experienced a range of emotions still tied to that genre, depending on the sound choices. With only music and no foley, the focus felt more centralized, as if my interpretation of the scene was being funnelled toward a specific atmosphere. On the other hand, when Foley sounds like rustling and footsteps were added, I felt physically present within the space. This made me recognize how vital sound design is in creating an effective and immersive audience experience in any visual work.</p>

<p><b>Paper analysis and overview of David Huron‚Äôs Affect Induction Through Musical Sounds: An Ethological Perspective</b></p>
<p>Huron explains the size sound principle and how we generalize certain auditory perspectives, such as relating large objects to low frequency vibrations and small objects to high frequency ones. For example, in opera, main characters or protagonists are often represented with a tenor or soprano voice, while antagonists, intermediaries, or villains are typically assigned a bass, baritone, or dramatic alto soprano voice to intensify their presence.</p>
<p>The film Jaws exemplifies this idea: low timbre conveys danger and tension. Without ever showing the shark, it is represented through the dark timbre of a cello. This links to ethological signals, for instance, a rattlesnake‚Äôs rattle signals to others that a predator is nearby, while a cue is a nonfunctional but informative behavio,r such as a mosquito‚Äôs buzz.</p>
<p>Notes: exhilaration is often associated with high arousal, medium to high pitch, and a sense of confidence. Mirror neurons also play a role, responding to motor actions, making the heart beat faster. In audio, this can be stimulated by higher BPM, while visuals and tempo shifts can amplify that physical activation.</p>
<p><b>Application to my creative work:</b></p>
<p>To evoke exhilaration in my project through a blend of visuals and effective sound design, I should avoid intentionally cueing sounds that give away what will happen. Instead, I can use dynamics, sudden shifts, and unexpected rhythmic changes to build and release tension, creating a more engaging and exhilarating sensory experience.</p>

I want to utilize both TouchDesigner and Blender to create my desired visuals that reflect the artistic techniques I have researched to evoke the feeling of exhilaration.</p>
    <p>I followed a Geometry Nodes Crash Course by Viscous Realm on YouTube. Through this, I learned how to use Geometry Nodes to simplify the process of replicating a sense of choreographed complexity in my work. I also explored how to make custom shaders and textures, which I hope will ease the lighting process, especially since I am working with 3D objects that require both lighting and fitting textures before rendering.</p>

 <p><b>The Sublime, Awe, & Fear </b></p>
 <p>This week‚Äôs focus was on the sublime, awe, and fear. I learned that the sublime is not just about beauty or grandeur, but about an experience that overwhelms the senses and pushes us beyond the ordinary. It mixes awe with elements of fear, vastness, and intensity, creating a paradox of both terror and delight.</p>
 <p>What stood out to me is how all sublime experiences involve awe, but not all awe is sublime. Awe can simply be about wonder or reverence, but the sublime takes it further by adding a sense of dread or overwhelming scale. It is that combination that makes the experience feel powerful and unforgettable.</p>
 <p>For me, the sublime feels like a journey where you go through different emotions before finally reaching a climax. I can see how this applies to audiovisual work: to create the sublime, you need to layer overwhelming visuals and sound with shifts in rhythm, scale, or perspective that make the audience feel small yet deeply moved. This reflection makes me think about how I might apply elements of the sublime in my own project, not necessarily to terrify, but to capture that balance between fear, awe, and exhilaration that keeps viewers engaged.</p>
 <p>Without safety = pure fear, Without threat = mere beauty.  </p>

    <p>For this week‚Äôs progress, I have created and recorded two alternative moving visuals for one of the stages in my project. This stage represents the Immersion or Complexity Rising part of the six exhilarating stages, where rapid instancing builds dense structures such as fractals, swarms, or tessellations. It also connects directly to my research argument on Exhilaration through Choreographed Complexity (one of the three approaches I am exploring). </p>

    </ul>

    <p>At this point, the visuals are still monochrome, uncolored, and simply screen recordings of the TouchDesigner session rather than finalized renders. This is because they are only rough drafts, not final outputs. Moving forward, I plan to refine the movement, apply color, and polish the overall aesthetic to better express a sense of exhilarating metamorphosis. For now, these drafts act as progress markers and early representations of the direction I am aiming to deliver in the upcoming presentation.</p>

  <h1>Assessment 1: HMsEx state profile</h1>


<h3> What ‚ÄúExhilarating‚Äù means to me</h3>
<p>I would define exhilarating as that heart-thumping, soul-igniting feeling that catches you unexpectedly and so deeply it takes you somewhere until you forget yourself for a moment. Drawing from my appreciation of Big Band and Swing-era jazz, I associate this feeling with the gradual build-up of a performance with each note and rhythm intensifying, accompanied by the light staccato of a crooner‚Äôs scat, culminating in a climactic moment that elevates the listener. I often seek this sensation during my daily walk to campus. Those fleeting moments when time seems to pause, the senses sharpen, and I feel unusually alive. </p>

<h3> Visually?</h3>

<p> As my practice in this studio will primarily involve 3D design and visual programming, I'd define the term 'exhilarating' as a visual phenomenom that radiates an uncontrollable surge of energy. I feel like it is an aesthetic quality that goes beyond passive observation, actively engaging the viewer through dynamic composition, unexpected forms, and intense sensory stimulation. Through observing these design/art examples, I found that they all have one thing in common: none of them 'play it safe' although most of them are leaning towards the 'decorative' aspect.  Instead, they challenge expectations, evoke surprise, and elevate the experience to an affective level. These works demonstrate that exhilaration in design is not merely about visual impact, but about creating a visceral response.  </p>

      <h2>1. The Vessel at Hudson Yards</h2>
      <img src="VesselNewYork.jpg" alt="The Vessel">

      <p>For the first example, in architecture, it might be a structure that looks as if it is rising boldly into the sky or twists in a way that defies your expectations. Which brings us to my first design example, which is The Vessel at Hudson Yards, New York. </p>
      <p>Architecturally, its towering honeycomb-like structure draws the eye upwards and invites physical movement through its spiralling staircases. The sense of verticality, repetition, and open air all create a thrilling spatial experience. Moreover, the underlying mechanics are rooted in visual rhythm, symmetry, and scale (makes me feel tiny or powerless; maybe megalophobia?).</p>
      <p>This structure best represents exhilaration because the constant shift in perspective as you ascend or descend mirrors the emotional lift you feel, the same way a piece of music might build to a climax. According to architectural theorists like Juhani Pallasmaa, at least from what I gathered, when architecture activates the full range of human perception not just what we see but how we move, feel, and inhabit a space it creates a deeper emotional and psychological impact. With that in mind, The Vessel succeeded in giving me that when I first experienced it.</p>
      <p>Some of the mechanics that I might apply or try to replicate in my design work would include the incorporation of verticality and layered transitions, such as using rising paths or structures that gradually reveal new views or stages (and it pulls you into it). Second and last, the use of repetition and rhythm in form, such as intertwining lines, staircases, or built-up narrative momentum. </p>

      <h2>2. The Tetris Effect</h2>
      <img src="TetrisEffect.jpg" alt="Tetris">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urbLIyd-VsQ&t=458s"> video </a>

      <p>My second example is The Tetris Effect, which stands out as an exhilarating experience not just because of the gameplay, but because of how it fully immerses your senses. Although the game has simple mechanics with the repetitive action of rotating and dropping blocks, this particular version gradually transforms the experience into something visually stunning and overwhelming as you progress. It builds serotonin as every movement syncs with fast-paced music, blended with a diverse movement of light that‚Äôs ongoing in the background.</p>
      <p>I realized how valuable the synesthetic experience of your eyes, ears, and hands all working together is. It forces you to stay nonstop engaged with the experience, and I want to incorporate that. Hence, in my own design work, I want to explore how that kind of multisensory layering can force full engagement. The psychological aspect of The Tetris Effect keeps you locked in, with sound and visuals responding instantly to every action, creating an addictive yet emotionally charged rhythm that builds exhilaration naturally. I am interested in designing interactions or experiences that make users feel immersed and aware of their senses at every moment, so that engagement isn‚Äôt just required, it is felt. (Analogy: driving a manual car, you somewhat become one with it because you have to be in tune with the engine, gears, and road.)</p>

      <h2>3. Test Pattern [N¬∞12]</h2>
      <img src="testpattern_no6_2.jpg" alt="Test Pattern1">
      <p>Ryoji Ikeda‚Äôs ‚Äòtest pattern‚Äô is one of the most exhilarating audiovisual installations. Though it might overlap with the theme of mesmerizing, I still find this to be appropriate. I would say that this particular example has somewhat similar traits to the Tetris Effect. The velocity of visuals flashing hundreds of frames per second purposely disorients and energizes the senses at once. It‚Äôs not just intense; it‚Äôs immersive. So, it will result in an overwhelming but thrilling sensory experience that locks you into the moment with full focus and heightened awareness. </p>
      <p>Ikeda himself explains that test pattern was created to ‚Äúexplore how far technology can push our senses and how close it can get to the limits of what we can physically see and hear‚Äù. He describes the visuals as images that ‚Äúfloat and convulse / agitate violently ‚Äù at extreme speeds.</p>
      <p>The rapid alternation between black and white, silence and sudden noise, builds a kind of emotional momentum that feels like a non-verbal crescendo. It‚Äôs undoubtedly minimal, but it is unforgettable and hits you hard. </p>
      <img src="ryoji-test-pattern-mock.jpg" alt="Test Pattern2">

      <p>In my own design work, I want to apply similar mechanics by creating experiences that demand full sensory attention. What excites me about the test pattern is how it uses precision and repetition to pull you in. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to passively observe; it forces engagement. That pressure, that total absorption, is what creates the feeling of exhilaration. I‚Äôm interested in designing environments or media where light, sound, and rhythm act together to keep users alert, immersed, and in sync with the system. The sensory feedback loop becomes so tight and tense that it is impossible not to feel present in the moment.</p>

      <h2>4.  Berstein's Rhapsody in Blue - Gershwin</h2>
      <img src="Berstein.jpg" alt="Rhapsody in Blue">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH2PH0auTUU"> video </a>

      <p>Stepping back to my passion in music, I would have to include conductor and composer, Leonard Bernstein‚Äôs rendition of the American Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin with the New York Philharmonic, this one particular recording of its live performance in 1976 in the Royal Albert Hall, which was uplifting, breathtaking, stimulating, and deeply exhilarating. </p>
      <p>What makes this performance so exhilarating is how it builds momentum through rhythm, melody, and dynamics, pulling the listener into a playful yet powerful flow. Every tempo shift and jazz-infused phrase feels like an emotional gear shift, and the closer it gets to its finale, the more it feels like the music is lifting you up and throwing you into the air.</p>
      <p>This might have no relation to design, but what I‚Äôve come to understand through watching Bernstein‚Äôs Rhapsody in Blue is that exhilaration in classical performance doesn‚Äôt just come from the music itself; it comes from the unique interpretation behind it. Some people tend to dismiss classical musicians as mere cover artists, but that completely overlooks the role of the conductor. Each conductor brings their own perspective, style, and emotional reading to the piece, which completely changes how it‚Äôs performed and felt. Bernstein, in particular, infuses the music with his own energy and charisma, guiding the orchestra not just through technical cues but through expressive intention. I‚Äôve learned that this is why no two recordings of the same classical piece ever feel the same. The conductor‚Äôs interpretation during rehearsals and live performances deeply shapes the final outcome. That‚Äôs where the exhilaration lives: in the spontaneity, the nuance, and the human expression that emerges from a shared structure.</p>
      <p>Back in context, what drives the exhilaration here is a mix of technical mastery and performative expression. Bernstein‚Äôs interpretation highlights the tension and release embedded in Gershwin‚Äôs score, but the element that I want to try and attempt to incorporate and recreate is the orchestral sound and feeling that will intensify my creative work, which would require a bit of composing and good pacing with the visuals.

      <h2>5. Vintage Las Vegas Artstyle</h2>
      <img src="n-LAS-VEGAS-628x314.jpg" alt="Las Vegas">

      <p>I want to incorporate the lavish, Las Vegas-style design and experience essentially a blend of post-modern, Googie, and desert-modern architecture. This style is defined by bold forms, eclectic and glamorous elements, and a strong focus on attention-grabbing aesthetics. While I‚Äôve been describing it from a design perspective, I want to illustrate this idea through a now-closed attraction: a small dancing fountain show that once ran in a mall back in my hometown.</p>
      <p>Even though it wasn‚Äôt a major artwork, I want to recreate the same sense of excitement and wonder I felt as a child experiencing it for the first time.</p>

      <p>The Dancing Fountain Show at Grand Indonesia, I could either keep this as an example or find an alternate that has similar descriptions. I plan to explore this further and reflect on how I might capture and translate that exhilarating feeling into my own creative work.</p>

      <h2>5. Rush Hour V</h2>
      <img src="noman.jpg" alt="Rush Hour V">
      <p>Nyoman Nuarta‚Äôs copper and bronze sculpture Rush Hour V is a design example that looks and feels exhilarating. A sweeping artwork spanning over three metres, it depicts cyclists in intense motion. The sense of exhilaration is generated through layered repetition and implied movement: multiple overlapping figures sculpted in succession suggest continuous motion through time and space. The twisting, wind‚Äëline textures reinforce urgency and kinetic thrust, like the relentless pulse of a cycle during peak rush hour (Mukabumi, 2020).</p>
      <p>The work captures the exhilaration of being swept up in collective movement, the rush hour frenzy of human energy, compressed into a moment of speed and connection. Even though it‚Äôs still, you can almost feel the wind on your face, your muscles tensing. It‚Äôs visual adrenaline: tension, momentum, acceleration all carved into metal.</p>
      <p>For my creative practice and design work, I want to imply motion through the layering of repeated and staggered colors and movement or other visual elements to suggest movement over time, even in static form. </p>

      <p> In sculptural 3D forms, I could play with flowing geometry, curves, or repeating forms that spiral or cascade, like waves or ribbons, to give the eye a path to follow. The goal is to activate the space visually and emotionally, making it feel like the work is alive, breathing, vibrating, or accelerating.</p>

      <h2>6. Jeff Koons‚Äô Balloon Dog</h2>
      <p>Next up is Jeff Koons‚Äô Balloon Dog. Through sheer visual impact and sensory delight, supporting it with its 3 metres height, the sculpture mimics the lightness and fragility of a twisted party balloon, but is made entirely of high-polished stainless steel. I appreciate the irony and contradiction between the material and subject that creates an immediate sense of tension and wonder. </p>
    
      <img src="Jeff_Koons_e_i_suoi_iconici_Balloon_Dogs_-_un_viaggio_tra_arte_e_meraviglia.jpg" alt="Balloon Dog">

      <p>What I find exhilarating about the art is how the shiny surface exaggerates color and light, producing a near-hypnotic experience that feels joyful, playful, and a little surreal. It‚Äôs as if the childish joy of a balloon animal has been amplified to monumental proportions, triggering both nostalgia and awe (Legge, 2023) </p>
      <p>What makes Balloon Dog exhilarating is the emotional contradiction: it feels both familiar and overwhelming. It exaggerates something fleeting and light into something heavy, reflective, and permanent. That tension is exciting to me, how Koons uses precision, finish, and scale to turn a simple object into an overwhelming experience In my own design work, I want to explore how visual exaggeration, unexpected materials, or scale can elevate everyday symbols into something that grabs attention and provokes feeling. Hence, material-wise, I could replicate since I delve into 3D modelling and design through experimenting with different materials and textures with a play of different lighting. Moreover, Balloon Dog reminds me that exhilaration can be built not just through motion or complexity, but through delight, boldness, and the unexpected.</p>

      <h2>7. Gamelan Semara Ratih of Ubud, Bali, Indonesia  </h2>
     <img src="gamelan.jpg" alt="Gamelans">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEWCCSuHsuQ&list=RDUEWCCSuHsuQ&start_radio=1"> video </a>


      <p>This next experience would have the sound powering over visuals. Gamelan music, especially when it‚Äôs heard live, is a deeply exhilarating experience. Truthfully, as a person who occasionally listens to traditional Indonesian Gamelan music, particularly Balinese and Javanese. Moreover, as a person who is ethnically from Indonesia, it would be easier for me to enjoy it than someone who had never heard of a gamelan being hit because there is a cultural influence; hence, different people would respond differently to the sound. Here is a performance example of the kind of sound I might want to replicate or use in my creative work:</p>


      <p>At first, it can feel calm or hypnotic, but as the layered rhythms build and the tempo accelerates, it pulls you into a kind of ecstatic trance. In a live setting, the sound would feel like it‚Äôs surrounding you, although it‚Äôs in front. You feel the vibrations in your chest. Every hit of the gong or sudden stop in the rhythm feels like a sensory jolt. It‚Äôs communal, embodied, and atmospheric, where even silence is loaded with anticipation, and that I find super exhilarating. </p>
      

     <p>You feel the vibrations in your chest. Every hit of the gong or sudden stop in the rhythm feels like a sensory jolt. It‚Äôs communal, embodied, and atmospheric, where even silence is loaded with anticipation. What I‚Äôve learned from Gamelan in terms of design is the power of rhythmic layering and how structure doesn‚Äôt need to be linear to be impactful.  </p>

<p> Gamelan music's exhilarating quality comes from its unique combination of intricate rhythms, bright and percussive sounds, and the way the instruments interact with each other. The fast-paced, interlocking patterns (kotekan) create a dynamic and complex texture, while the large gongs and metallophones produce a powerful, resonant sound. 
</p>


      <p> In my own creative work, I want to explore how repetition and poly-rhythmic structure, whether in visual or sonic form, can build emotional intensity over time, and maybe I could sample and USE a bit from that recording onto my project.</p>

      <h2>8. Interior / Spatial design of BMW Welt building</h2>
      <img src="BMW1.jpg" alt="BMW1">
      <p>The Interior / Spatial design of the BMW Welt building, designed by Coop Himmelb(l)au is another architectural or interior experience that fits the theme of exhilaration perfectly. At first glance, there is no flat, neutral moment; every part of the space directs your gaze upward, around, or forward, making you feel as though you‚Äôve entered a machine in motion. The sheer scale, reflective materials, and sculptural lighting complement how we observe the cars strategically placed and spread around the space, undoubtedly contributing to a heightened sensory awareness, as if the building itself is breathing with energy. </p>

      <img src="BMW2.jpg" alt="BMW2">

      <p> Similarly to what I had stated above of what these examples have in common is that they never play it safe. The exhilaration here comes from how the interior bends architectural expectations. Instead of clean, static order, the design embraces asymmetry, layering, and motion. Light bounces unpredictably off surfaces; materials blend metal, glass, and steel with fluid transitions. According to Coop Himmelb(l)au, their philosophy centers on ‚Äúarchitecture that burns‚Äù (or blazes),  meaning architecture that moves, provokes, and energizes.  </p>
      <p> Although the orchestration of openness, layering, and material contrast is truly admirable, what caught my eye the most as a designer was its ability to evoke a constantly shifting spatial sensation. The voids, vertical drops, and layered pathways create a rhythm that physically energizes me, as if the space itself is alive, moving and accelerating around me. It feels like being inside a car engine. That, to me, is where its exhilarating radiance comes from.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm definitely going to dig deeper and do more research into the interior elements of this building. In my creative work, I want to explore how exhilaration can emerge effortlessly from a space or experience that unfolds gradually. It doesn‚Äôt have to be loud or chaotic to be powerful.</p>

        <p>‚ÄòLight Vortex‚Äô is just one of the hundreds of artworks or experiences displayed in an immersive audiovisual environment/park, essentially a digital art museum with no boundaries in Abu Dhabi, by teamLab Phenomena. ‚ÄòLight Vortex‚Äô is one of the two examples I selected from teamLab.  </p>
<p>This audiovisual installation evokes a sense of exhilaration in me through its overwhelming presence of light, hyper music, scale, and visual rhythm. What makes LightVortex exhilarating is how it manipulates scale and perspective with its luminous energy in hundreds of layered beams that pulse, rotate, and refract in hypnotic synchrony. As you stand within the vortex, the lights seem to twist around you, drawing you into the center of a moving storm. The sheer intensity of the lines, paired with the atmospheric soundtrack, creates a full-body sensation that is equal parts meditative and electrifying.</p>
<p>In my own design work, I‚Äôm inspired by how this piece builds exhilaration through movement and layering without using any narrative or literal imagery, but at the same time manipulates the scale and perspective, as if you‚Äôre within/in the middle of that vortex</p>

      <p>Also an exhilarating spatial experience by teamLab is the Morping Continuum. It surrounds the viewer in a living storm of reflective spheres/balloons?. These floating forms swarm through the space in unpredictable waves, gliding, clustering, and parting as if guided by an invisible force. This example in particular creates movement that feels organic and alive. The spheres pulse with changing light and color, while mirrored walls multiply their presence, making you feel more immersed and surrounded. </p>
      <p>What makes Morphing Continuum exhilarating is its ability to translate quantity and motion into emotion. It‚Äôs both unpredictable and precise, which keeps your attention fully engaged, moment by moment. In my creative work, I am mostly inspired by how this installation creates exhilaration through choreographed complexity; it might fall into ‚Äòoverwhelming‚Äô if not animated correctly, but the goal is to balance chaos and order to captivate the senses.</p>
<p>As both a 3D artist and visual programmer, I want to explore particle systems, motion behaviors, and especially reflective materials that can be wrapped around my moving FBXs. </p>
