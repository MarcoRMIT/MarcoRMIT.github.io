  <h1>Assessment 1: HMsEx state profile</h1>

<h3> Exhilarating!?</h3>
<p>Before I dive too deep, according to Google’s English dictionary provided by Oxford Languages, “exhilarating” means making someone feel happy, animated, or elated; thrilling. It is undoubtedly correct. However, I have a preferred definition of this particular feeling. 
</p>


<h3> What “Exhilarating” feels like (to me)</h3>
<p>I would define exhilarating as that heart-thumping, soul-igniting feeling that catches you unexpectedly and so deeply it takes you somewhere until you forget yourself for a moment. As an enthusiast of Big Bands / Jazz Bands in the Swing era, I exemplify it as when a performance slowly builds up/crescendoes in dynamic, note by note, and tempo while it’s being accompanied by a lighty staccato scat or adlib of a crooner like Sinatra, and finally reaches its climactic zone, pulling you up to it high above the noise of everyday life. I crave that spark during the walk to campus. It is that feeling where time pauses, your senses heighten, and you feel more awake than usual.</p>

<h3> Visually?</h3>
<p>If I had to describe exhilarating visually (because I’ll be mostly working with 3D and visual programming software in this studio), I would say it is when a design radiates like it’s bursting uncontrollably with energy. Throughout observing and further analyzing these 10 examples, I concluded that they all have one thing in common: They don’t play it safe. It pushes, surprises, and elevates. It’s the kind of visual experience that doesn’t just show you something, and makes you feel it, and further on could be accompanied and complemented by audio.

      <h2>1. The Vessel at Hudson Yards</h2>
      <img src="VesselNewYork.jpg" alt="The Vessel">

      <p>For the first example, in architecture, it might be a structure that looks as if it is rising boldly into the sky or twists in a way that defies your expectations. Which brings us to my first design example, which is The Vessel at Hudson Yards, New York. </p>
      <p>Architecturally, its towering honeycomb-like structure draws the eye upwards and invites physical movement through its spiralling staircases. The sense of verticality, repetition, and open air all create a thrilling spatial experience. Moreover, the underlying mechanics are rooted in visual rhythm, symmetry, and scale (makes me feel tiny or powerless; maybe megalophobia?).</p>
      <p>This structure best represents exhilaration because the constant shift in perspective as you ascend or descend mirrors the emotional lift you feel, the same way a piece of music might build to a climax. According to architectural theorists like Juhani Pallasmaa, author and architect, at least from what I gathered, when architecture activates the full range of human perception not just what we see but how we move, feel, and inhabit a space it creates a deeper emotional and psychological impact. With that in mind, The Vessel succeeded in giving me that when I first experienced it.</p>
      <p>Some of the mechanics that I might apply or try to replicate in my design work would include the incorporation of verticality and layered transitions, such as using rising paths or structures that gradually reveal new views or stages (and it pulls you into it). Second and last, the use of repetition and rhythm in form, such as intertwining lines, staircases, or built-up narrative momentum. </p>

      <h2>2. The Tetris Effect</h2>
      <img src="TetrisEffect.jpg" alt="Tetris">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urbLIyd-VsQ&t=458s"> video </a>

      <p>My second example is The Tetris Effect, which stands out as an exhilarating experience not just because of the gameplay, but because of how it fully immerses your senses. Although the game has simple mechanics with the repetitive action of rotating and dropping blocks, this particular version gradually transforms the experience into something visually stunning and overwhelming as you progress. I build serotonin as every movement syncs with fast-paced music, blended with a diverse movement of light that’s ongoing in the background.</p>
      <p>I realized how valuable the synesthetic experience of your eyes, ears, and hands all working together is. It forces you to stay nonstop engaged with the experience, and I want to incorporate that. Hence, in my own design work, I want to explore how that kind of multisensory layering can force full engagement. The psychological aspect of The Tetris Effect keeps you locked in, with sound and visuals responding instantly to every action, creating an addictive yet emotionally charged rhythm that builds exhilaration naturally. I am interested in designing interactions or experiences that make users feel immersed and aware of their senses at every moment, so that engagement isn’t just required, it is felt. (Analogy: driving a manual car, you somewhat become one with it because you have to be in tune with the engine, gears, and road.)</p>

      <h2>3. Test Pattern [N°12]</h2>
      <img src="testpattern_no6_2.jpg" alt="Test Pattern1">
      <p>Ryoji Ikeda’s ‘test pattern’ is one of the most exhilarating audiovisual installations. Though it might overlap with the theme of mesmerizing, I still find this to be appropriate. I would say that this particular example has somewhat similar traits to the Tetris Effect. The velocity of visuals flashing hundreds of frames per second purposely disorients and energizes the senses at once. It’s not just intense; it’s immersive. So, it will result in an overwhelming but thrilling sensory experience that locks you into the moment with full focus and heightened awareness. </p>
      <p>Ikeda itself explains that test pattern was created to “explore how far technology can push our senses and how close it can get to the limits of what we can physically see and hear”. He describes the visuals as images that “float and convulse” at extreme speeds.</p>
      <p>The rapid alternation between black and white, silence and sudden noise, builds a kind of emotional momentum that feels like a non-verbal crescendo. It’s undoubtedly minimal, but it is unforgettable and hits you hard. </p>
      <img src="ryoji-test-pattern-mock.jpg" alt="Test Pattern2">

      <p>In my own design work, I want to apply similar mechanics by creating experiences that demand full sensory attention. What excites me about the test pattern is how it uses precision and repetition to pull you in. It doesn’t allow you to passively observe; it forces engagement. That pressure, that total absorption, is what creates the feeling of exhilaration. I’m interested in designing environments or media where light, sound, and rhythm act together to keep users alert, immersed, and in sync with the system. The sensory feedback loop becomes so tight and tense that it is impossible not to feel present in the moment.</p>

      <h2>4.  Berstein's Rhapsody in Blue - Gershwin</h2>
      <img src="Berstein.jpg" alt="Rhapsody in Blue">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH2PH0auTUU"> video </a>

      <p>Stepping back to my passion in music, I would have to include conductor and composer, Leonard Bernstein’s rendition of the American Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin with the New York Philharmonic, this one particular recording of its live performance in 1976 in the Royal Albert Hall, which was uplifting, breathtaking, stimulating, and deeply exhilarating. </p>
      <p>What makes this performance so exhilarating is how it builds momentum through rhythm, syncopation, and dynamics, pulling the listener into a playful yet powerful flow. Every tempo shift and jazz-infused phrase feels like an emotional gear shift, and the closer it gets to its finale, the more it feels like the music is lifting you up and throwing you into the air.</p>
      <p>This might have no relation to design, but what I’ve come to understand through watching Bernstein’s Rhapsody in Blue is that exhilaration in classical performance doesn’t just come from the music itself; it comes from the unique interpretation behind it. Some people tend to dismiss classical musicians as mere cover artists, but that completely overlooks the role of the conductor. Each conductor brings their own perspective, style, and emotional reading to the piece, which completely changes how it’s performed and felt. Bernstein, in particular, infuses the music with his own energy and charisma, guiding the orchestra not just through technical cues but through expressive intention. I’ve learned that this is why no two recordings of the same classical piece ever feel the same. The conductor’s interpretation during rehearsals and live performances deeply shapes the final outcome. That’s where the exhilaration lives: in the spontaneity, the nuance, and the human expression that emerges from a shared structure.</p>
      <p>Back in context, what drives the exhilaration here is a mix of technical mastery and performative expression. Bernstein’s interpretation highlights the tension and release embedded in Gershwin’s score, moments of lyrical softness that suddenly burst into bold, orchestral exclamations. It’s cinematic in scale and intimate in feeling. In my own creative work, I want to capture that same kind of emotional pacing where rhythm, contrast, and expression build into something that doesn’t just sound beautiful or look good, but feels electric.</p>

      <h2>5. Vintage Las Vegas Artstyle</h2>
      <img src="n-LAS-VEGAS-628x314.jpg" alt="Las Vegas">

      <p>I want to incorporate the lavish, Las Vegas-style design and experience essentially a blend of post-modern, Googie, and desert-modern architecture. This style is defined by bold forms, eclectic and glamorous elements, and a strong focus on attention-grabbing aesthetics. While I’ve been describing it from a design perspective, I want to illustrate this idea through a now-closed attraction: a small dancing fountain show that once ran in a mall back in my hometown.</p>
      <p>Even though it wasn’t a major artwork, I want to recreate the same sense of excitement and wonder I felt as a child experiencing it for the first time.</p>

      <p>The Dancing Fountain Show at Grand Indonesia, I could either keep this as an example or find an alternate that has similar descriptions. I plan to explore this further and reflect on how I might capture and translate that exhilarating feeling into my own creative work.</p>

      <h2>6. Rush Hour V</h2>
      <img src="noman.jpg" alt="Rush Hour V">
      <p>Nyoman Nuarta’s copper and bronze sculpture Rush Hour V is a design example that looks and feels exhilarating. A sweeping artwork spanning over three metres, it depicts cyclists in intense motion. The sense of exhilaration is generated through layered repetition and implied movement: multiple overlapping figures sculpted in succession suggest continuous motion through time and space. The twisting, wind‑line textures reinforce urgency and kinetic thrust, like the relentless pulse of a cycle during peak rush hour (Mukabumi, 2020).</p>
      <p>The work captures the exhilaration of being swept up in collective movement, the rush hour frenzy of human energy, compressed into a moment of speed and connection. Even though it’s still, you can almost feel the wind on your face, your muscles tensing. It’s visual adrenaline: tension, momentum, acceleration all carved into metal.</p>
      <p>For my creative practice and design work, I want to imply motion through the layering of repeated and staggered colors and movement or other visual elements to suggest movement over time, even in static form. </p>

      <h2>7. Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog</h2>
      <p>Next up is Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog. Through sheer visual impact and sensory delight, supporting it with its 3 metres height, the sculpture mimics the lightness and fragility of a twisted party balloon, but is made entirely of high-polished stainless steel. I appreciate the irony and contradiction between the material and subject that creates an immediate sense of tension and wonder. </p>
    
      <img src="Jeff_Koons_e_i_suoi_iconici_Balloon_Dogs_-_un_viaggio_tra_arte_e_meraviglia.jpg" alt="Balloon Dog">

      <p>What I find exhilarating about the art is how the shiny surface exaggerates color and light, producing a near-hypnotic experience that feels joyful, playful, and a little surreal. It’s as if the childish joy of a balloon animal has been amplified to monumental proportions, triggering both nostalgia and awe (Legge, 2023) </p>
      <p>What makes Balloon Dog exhilarating is the emotional contradiction: it feels both familiar and overwhelming. It exaggerates something fleeting and light into something heavy, reflective, and permanent. That tension is exciting to me, how Koons uses precision, finish, and scale to turn a simple object into an overwhelming experience In my own design work, I want to explore how visual exaggeration, unexpected materials, or scale can elevate everyday symbols into something that grabs attention and provokes feeling. Hence, material-wise, I could replicate since I delve into 3D modelling and design through experimenting with different materials and textures with a play of different lighting. Moreover, Balloon Dog reminds me that exhilaration can be built not just through motion or complexity, but through delight, boldness, and the unexpected.</p>

      <h2>8. Gamelan Orchestra</h2>
     <img src="gamelan.jpg" alt="Gamelans">
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEWCCSuHsuQ&list=RDUEWCCSuHsuQ&start_radio=1"> video </a>


      <p>This next experience would have the sound powering over visuals. Gamelan music, especially when it’s heard live, is a deeply exhilarating experience. Truthfully, as a person who occasionally listens to traditional Indonesian Gamelan music, particularly Balinese and Javanese. Moreover, as a person who is ethnically from Indonesia, it would be easier for me to enjoy it than someone who had never heard of a gamelan being hit because there is a cultural influence; hence, different people would respond differently to the sound. Here is a performance example of the kind of sound I might want to replicate or use in my creative work:</p>


      <p>At first, it can feel calm or hypnotic, but as the layered rhythms build and the tempo accelerates, it pulls you into a kind of ecstatic trance. In a live setting, the sound would feel like it’s surrounding you, although it’s in front. You feel the vibrations in your chest. Every hit of the gong or sudden stop in the rhythm feels like a sensory jolt. It’s communal, embodied, and atmospheric, where even silence is loaded with anticipation, and that I find super exhilarating. </p>
      

     <p>You feel the vibrations in your chest. Every hit of the gong or sudden stop in the rhythm feels like a sensory jolt. It’s communal, embodied, and atmospheric, where even silence is loaded with anticipation. What I’ve learned from Gamelan in terms of design is the power of rhythmic layering and how structure doesn’t need to be linear to be impactful. In my own creative work, I want to explore how repetition and poly-rhythmic structure, whether in visual or sonic form, can build emotional intensity over time, and maybe I could sample and USE a bit from that recording onto my project. </p>

      <h2>9. Interior / Spatial design of BMW Welt building</h2>
      <img src="BMW1.jpg" alt="BMW1">
      <p>The Interior / Spatial design of the BMW Welt building, designed by Coop Himmelb(l)au is another architectural or interior experience that fits the theme of exhilaration perfectly. At first glance, there is no flat, neutral moment; every part of the space directs your gaze upward, around, or forward, making you feel as though you’ve entered a machine in motion. The sheer scale, reflective materials, and sculptural lighting complement how we observe the cars strategically placed and spread around the space, undoubtedly contributing to a heightened sensory awareness, as if the building itself is breathing with energy. </p>
