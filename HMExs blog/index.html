      <h2>1. The Vessel at Hudson Yards</h2>
      <img src="images/vessel.jpg" alt="The Vessel">
      <p>For the first example, in architecture, it might be a structure that looks as if it is rising boldly into the sky or twists in a way that defies your expectations. Which brings us to my first design example, which is The Vessel at Hudson Yards, New York. </p>
      <p>Architecturally, its towering honeycomb-like structure draws the eye upwards and invites physical movement through its spiralling staircases. The sense of verticality, repetition, and open air all create a thrilling spatial experience. Moreover, the underlying mechanics are rooted in visual rhythm, symmetry, and scale (makes me feel tiny or powerless; maybe megalophobia?).</p>
      <p>This structure best represents exhilaration because the constant shift in perspective as you ascend or descend mirrors the emotional lift you feel, the same way a piece of music might build to a climax. According to architectural theorists like Juhani Pallasmaa, author and architect, at least from what I gathered, when architecture activates the full range of human perception not just what we see but how we move, feel, and inhabit a space it creates a deeper emotional and psychological impact. With that in mind, The Vessel succeeded in giving me that when I first experienced it.</p>
      <p>Some of the mechanics that I might apply or try to replicate in my design work would include the incorporation of verticality and layered transitions, such as using rising paths or structures that gradually reveal new views or stages (and it pulls you into it). Second and last, the use of repetition and rhythm in form, such as intertwining lines, staircases, or built-up narrative momentum. </p>

      <h2>2. The Tetris Effect</h2>
      <img src="images/tetris.jpg" alt="Tetris Effect">
      <p>My second example is The Tetris Effect, which stands out as an exhilarating experience not just because of the gameplay, but because of how it fully immerses your senses. Although the game has simple mechanics with the repetitive action of rotating and dropping blocks, this particular version gradually transforms the experience into something visually stunning and overwhelming as you progress. I build serotonin as every movement syncs with fast-paced music, blended with a diverse movement of light that’s ongoing in the background.</p>
      <p>I realized how valuable the synesthetic experience of your eyes, ears, and hands all working together is. It forces you to stay nonstop engaged with the experience, and I want to incorporate that. Hence, in my own design work, I want to explore how that kind of multisensory layering can force full engagement. The psychological aspect of The Tetris Effect keeps you locked in, with sound and visuals responding instantly to every action, creating an addictive yet emotionally charged rhythm that builds exhilaration naturally. I am interested in designing interactions or experiences that make users feel immersed and aware of their senses at every moment, so that engagement isn’t just required, it is felt. (Analogy: driving a manual car, you somewhat become one with it because you have to be in tune with the engine, gears, and road.)</p>

      <h2>3. Test Pattern [N°12]</h2>
      <img src="images/tetris.jpg" alt="Tetris Effect">
      <p>Ryoji Ikeda’s ‘test pattern’ is one of the most exhilarating audiovisual installations. Though it might overlap with the theme of mesmerizing, I still find this to be appropriate. I would say that this particular example has somewhat similar traits to the Tetris Effect. The velocity of visuals flashing hundreds of frames per second purposely disorients and energizes the senses at once. It’s not just intense; it’s immersive. So, it will result in an overwhelming but thrilling sensory experience that locks you into the moment with full focus and heightened awareness. </p>
      <p>Ikeda itself explains that test pattern was created to “explore how far technology can push our senses and how close it can get to the limits of what we can physically see and hear”. He describes the visuals as images that “float and convulse” at extreme speeds.</p>
      <p>The rapid alternation between black and white, silence and sudden noise, builds a kind of emotional momentum that feels like a non-verbal crescendo. It’s undoubtedly minimal, but it is unforgettable and hits you hard. </p>
      <p>In my own design work, I want to apply similar mechanics by creating experiences that demand full sensory attention. What excites me about the test pattern is how it uses precision and repetition to pull you in. It doesn’t allow you to passively observe; it forces engagement. That pressure, that total absorption, is what creates the feeling of exhilaration. I’m interested in designing environments or media where light, sound, and rhythm act together to keep users alert, immersed, and in sync with the system. The sensory feedback loop becomes so tight and tense that it is impossible not to feel present in the moment.</p>
