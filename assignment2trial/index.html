    <title>LunaMarc</title>
    <!-- Player name inspo: "Luna" means Moon, which reflects a night-focused
    aesthetic. Marco is my name :p. My vision is to create a media music player
    specifically designed for students or anyone who studies and works at night.
    It's made specifically for night owls like me (those who are most productive
    at night after dark), or for people who need to work through the night and
    stay up late to meet deadlines! That is why LunaMarc is created!! -->
